- Use labels instead of entry boxes

Note for 7/29:
- We have determined that you can use {vkXX} in AHK to send keyboard commands which 
are the virtual key code, making life much easier. While tkinter provides the keycodes in 
decimal, we can conver them to hex(). All we need to do now is to create an easy
filter for the virtual keys to appear on the display, which can be done via a .csv
Also filter which vkeys need to be used in the first place
