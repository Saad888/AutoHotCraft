1. Loops through crafts by sending AHK script commands via command line and sending args 
2. Accounts for food and collectables
3. User can select when they need to use food or collectables or not
4. Will ideally be able to run in the background without issue
5. Profiles for various macro lengths


Pseudocode/Process:

1. Test connection to ensure FFXIV was found
2. If found, begins main loop 
    A) Sends command with first macro
    B) Waits until completion
    C) Send command for second macro if exists and Waits
    D) Repeat for third
    E) After all macros complete, hits confirm on collectable window if exists
    F) If food is active:
        Fa) Set current food time based on start and end timer
        Fb) Check length of next craft
        Fc) If lenght < food time (with margin of error) cancel craft and activate food
        Fd) Re-initialize the craft
