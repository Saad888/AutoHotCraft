help_text = """Using AutoHotCraft:
Click or tab over to a hotkey input window. Click on it again or hit space to activate it. When the window turns yellow, press any key (with modifiers like shift, ctrl, or alt if needed) to save the input. 

For macros, in the time window enter the length of the macro in seconds. If you are using two or three macros, be sure to select the check mark next to the time to use them during the craft.

If you are using food or potions (syrup), place them on your hotbar and enter the keybind for the food/pot into AutoHotCraft. Under the time, put in the remaining time left on the active food and pot before starting the craft. Be sure to select the checkmark if you are using them. 
IMPORTANT: If you want to automatically refresh food and pots, when you first initiate the craft you MUST find the item  you are making manually through the crafting window menus and NOT use the search feature to find the craft. 

You must have a selection for Confirm (default is Numpad 0), Craft Window (default is N), and closing menus (default is ESC).

Along the bottom you can select 30 or 40 minute food times and enable collectable crafting.

NOTE: To begin using the autocraft, your char must be sitting within a craft ready to being. AHC's first action will be to initiate the first macro. 

Please see the ReadMe for more details (can also find it here: https://github.com/Saad888/AutoHotCraft)
